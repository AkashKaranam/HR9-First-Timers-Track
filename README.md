# HR8.5-First-Timers-Track

## Track Description

We live in a world where everything is customized, from your Coffehouse order to the technology you use. So why shouldn't your browser be too? Chrome extensions allow you to craft and tailor your ideal browsing experience in a few short lines of code. In this track, you'll learn how to build a Chrome extension from scratch using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

## Introduction

Welcome to HackRice 8.5! This track is intended for teams in which a majority of members have little to no experience with software development. We'll help you get started by providing instructions on how to set up your environment and providing some basic code for you to expand on. If you have attended previous hackathons (not counting Hack Rick 8), you're still welcome to use the provided code, but you won't be eligible to compete in the First Timers Track.

In this track, you'll create a Google Chrome extension of your choice to add functionality to the Chrome browser. You can create an application from scratch hosted in Chrome, build a tool to enhance/customize your online experience, integrate an existing platform with your browser, or write content scripts to modify webpage content. We're only providing you with enough to create a very simple, working framework -- it's up to you to build off of the base code we provide and make it useful or add functionality to solve a real world problem.
